**remix-adonisjs** includes all the amazing features you love from Remix, plus support for production-grade:
- Database ORM and migrations

...and much, much more from the AdonisJS 6 ecosystem. Read [the about section](https://remix-adonisjs.matstack.dev/about.html) if you want to learn more.

## Quickstart

Create a fresh remix-adonisjs project using the [Remix starter template](https://github.com/jarle/remix-starter-kit):

```
npm init adonisjs -- -K="github:jarle/remix-starter-kit"
```

You should now be able to start building.
Just jump into your new folder and start the dev server with `npm run dev`.
